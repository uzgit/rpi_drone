# Summary

I created a raspberry pi controlled drone as part of my science fair project that would eventually compete at the state level in the Texas State Science and Engineering Fair. This bad boy has served me well and I want to share this easy to print and assemble design to you guys in the 3D printed community!

# Post-Printing

## Assembly and considerations 

I cadded the whole quadcopter in Inventor from scratch in order to be easily and quickly 3D printed. To assemble the quadcopter, simply lay the angled arms into the main body and then snap on the top plates to sandwich everything together. The top plate, pegs, and spacer pieces are purely optional. I added then in case you wanted to place the battery on top of the quadcopter. For extra strength, I glued everything together with 2 part epoxy. Sanding may be necessary depending on the quality of the printer you are using*
